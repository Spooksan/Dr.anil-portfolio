                <h3>Coaching vs. Mentoring</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="coaching-mentoring">
                <p>It is important to understand the difference between coaching and mentoring as they are two distinct things. However, these terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
                <p>In mentoring, the mentor advises and shares their own experiences and is usually more experienced and qualified than the learner (or ‘mentee’). Furthermore, mentoring is a more long-term, ongoing relationship that takes a broader view of the person, with the mentor providing support and guidance to prepare the learner for possible future roles. So, mentoring revolves more around developing the person professionally.</p>
                <p>In coaching, the coach doesn’t advise and all the ‘content’ is the coachees. For this reason, the coach does not need to have direct experience of the coachee’s role. Furthermore, the coaching is usually focused on specific development areas or issues. Finally, the agenda is very much focused on achieving goals.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>A Model for Coaching <br>
                    The GROW Model
                </h3>
             <p>G-R-O-W model, asking you different types of questions at each stage in order to help you move closer toward their goal.</p>
             <h4>How Does it Work?</h4>
             <p>The coachee starts at ‘Goal’ (G), where they define their initial outcome(s) and goals with the aid of coach questioning. The next stage ‘Reality’ (R), requires the coachee to explore and describe their current state. The coach helps by asking questions that encourage self-assessment and evaluation. The following stage ‘Options’ (O), explores how the coachee can reach their goal, examining all possible options. The coach invites suggestions, and use supporting tools such as mind maps to make sure all options (regardless of how abstract) are fully explored.  The coach may offer suggestions, however carefully and sparingly, and only once the coachee has explored their own options/suggestions first. In the last stage ‘Will’ (W), sometimes called ‘Way Forward’ or ‘Wrap Up’, the coachee is encouraged to commit to an option or specific action with the coach helping to support and motivate.</p>
             <p>There are two more letters in Grow Model wherein it becomes the <strong>'GROWTH'</strong> model. (T), what tactics do you need to make it happen? (H), how are you going to sustain the idea moving forward?</p>
